                <p>Hi, I am a Masters Student in Data Science at EPFL in Switzerland.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The first question I usually get asked is how did I end up at a school in Switzerland? </p>
                <p class="tab">
                    I am actually part Swiss, part American. I grew up in California but visited my grandparents in the italian-speaking part of Switzerland most summers.
                    After I graduated college I had a yearning inside of me to explore the other half of my heritage, to learn a swiss language, and to live in a different place besides California.
                    Professionally, I had decided that I wanted to become an engineer and to meaningful contribute to a product that would improve people's lives. 
                    These two desires collided and have lead to me living in Lausanne, learning French and German, and studying to become a Data Scientist at one of the two Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The second question is, how tall are you?</p>
                <p class="tab">I usually answer this with the nice round number of 200 cm, even though without shoes, the truth is, I am only 198 cm.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I suppose now is the part where I tell you about my research goals and path forward in life.
                The truth is I am still figuring it out.
                Data Science is a huge field and narrowing down my interests has proven to be difficult.
                What I do know is that I want to work on things that are a net positive to this world. 
                I like fitness and am attracted to working on the processing of body data from wearable devices. 
                I think there is a future in decentralized systems </p>

                The things that feed my soul currently are:

                    <li>Freestyle swimming in Lac Leman (though it gets rather chilly in the winter)</li>
                    <li>Listening to biographies on audible. Currently, Churchill - Walking with Destiny by Andrew Roberts. </li>
                    <li>Wednesday running at a track with a group of friends</li>
                    <li>Bike rides through the stunning Lavaux region (with hilltop races and intermediate sprint competitions amongst friends.)</li>
